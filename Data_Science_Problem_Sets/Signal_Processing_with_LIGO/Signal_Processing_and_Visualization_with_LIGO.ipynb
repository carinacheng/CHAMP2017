What they saw was the result of two black holes, each roughly 30 times the mass of the sun approximately 400 Mpc (1.3 billion light years) away.

What you hear can be expressed as an amplitude as a function of time, which is precisely what a `.wav` file includes. While LIGO doesn't measure sound waves, the frequencies it \"listens\" are in the audible range (roughly 20 Hz to 20 kHz, though the top end generally gets lower as you get older). So for example, we can use the following function to play data vectors, be they simulated noise or LIGO signal, as sound. So turn your sound on and see if you can hear the difference!"

But if we just want to see the waveform itself, our best bet is not just to whiten, but actually filter off the frequencies we know are just noise. Filtering is a deep topic in signal processing, but the absolute simplest frequency filter is simply to Fourier transform, set some frequencies to 0, and then Fourier transform back. This isn't ideal for many applications, but it'll do for our purposes."

This is due to the fact that gravitational waves travel at the speed of light, and Hanford was slightly closer to the merger at the time the wave passed by Earth. With 3 or more detectors, these time delays can be used to triangulate the position of the source on the sky. This was done a couple of years after this with an event called [GW170817](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GW170817), the merger of two neutron stars, which was also observed as a gamma-ray burst and then followed up in the X-ray, optical, infrared, and radio."
