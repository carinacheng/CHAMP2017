# Git Tutorial

This session will introduce git in some more detail than the previous lessons, 
motivating *why* we need it, and how to use some of the low-level command-line 
instructions. 

The format of the presentation will be to go through this  
[overview and motivation for git](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1eN6YI7ZBmYrP-TRi1_E1-y7WXwXCG5mbiDYH06txk_k/edit?usp=sharing),
then proceed to the [hands-on tutorial](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/), before going back to the 
above presentation to finish off with a summary and best-practices.

The hands-on tutorial is designed to be run interactively. The instructor should 
write out the commands as they speak. It is recommended that students **not** have 
the tutorial open during the session, but they can refer to it afterwards to recap.
