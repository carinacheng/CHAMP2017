2021 Notes:
This year we did all computing remotely at NRAO. All students were given NRAO accounts, data were kept on nkern lustre space and copied
over to student space at beginning of the lesson.

2020 Notes:
Recent CASA versions have deprecated `plotuv`
Note that the data exceeds 1.3 GB, so hard-copy of data products were delivered in person to students.
