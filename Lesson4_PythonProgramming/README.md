# Advanced and Scientific Python

This session will continue the introduction to Python programming begun in 
[Lesson 2](../Lesson2_IntroToComputing), and move on to exploring some essential 
Python libraries for science.

## "Advanced" Python

This second Python intro course will attempt to finish the 
[Software Carpentry Tutorial](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/index.html)
begun in [Lesson 2](../Lesson2_IntroToComputing).

Topics covered -- in addition to those in Lesson2 that weren't covered due to time 
restrictions, will be (time permitting):

1. Lists
2. For Loops
3. Conditionals
4. Looping over data sets
5. Writing functions
6. Variable Scope
7. Programming Style

## Scientific Python

The format of the scientific python presentation is a 
[Jupyter notebook](ScientificProgramming/Scientific_Programming_in_Python.ipynb), which 
students are free to peruse after the main session for their own benefit. Other files in
that directory are supporting data.
